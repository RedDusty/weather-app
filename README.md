# Weatheredy App

### Currently using a fake request, but the real request is commented in code.

### Used:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
* [IpStack](https://ipstack.com/) - If the user blocks geolocation, IP will be used to determine the location.
